This document describes the branch strategy for Kinopoisk Parser developement. 

Branch strategy:
1) Each member creates his branch to develop and/or update existing project in order to keep stable version working.
2) Depending on progress and deadlines, members merge projects after successful tests passing.
3) In order to increase testing reliability, each member of the team tests each other's project version (aka implementing dogmeal testing). After all members are satisfied with the testing results, merging starts.
